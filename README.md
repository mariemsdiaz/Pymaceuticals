In this study we observed 249 mice who were identified wih having tumors. After treating the mice with a range of drug regimens we observed the efficacacy of particularly four drugs . Tumor development was observed and analysed. One specific drug named "Capoulin" was further studied to note its efficacy over the other drug regimens. 

Results: 
Firstly, we found that Capomulin, our particular drug of interest, and Ramicane had higher number of application per mice compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin. Propriva was tested the least in each mice. Boxplot analysis showed that Capomulin and Ramicane regimens were the most effective when it came to the decrease in size of mice tumor volume. Consequently we found that Ceftamin and Infubinol had the higher tumor volumes compared to the other other two. Interestingly enough, there was only one outlier belonging to the Infubinol treatment, who had an extremely low tumor volume of 36.21. 

Our second observation shows that there is a positive correlation (0.84) between the mouse weight and the average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen. This correlation tells us that, as the size of tumors decline in mouse, weight loss is also accompanied. The opposite is true, as the size of tumors increase, so does weight gain. 

The pie chart shows us that gender does not really play a role in the study, as the mice are evenly distributed between sexes. 

Finally, the scatter plot tells us and the regressed line between mouse weight and the average tumor volume tells us there is a strong correlation between mouse weight to tumor volume. The correlation between two variables is 0.84, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship. This means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well. The closer the correlation value is to 1, the stronger the relationship.
